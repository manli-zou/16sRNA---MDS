# Reads type: 
16sRNA sequencing (454 pyrosequencing) ï¼š 16s rRNA V2 region

# Sample body site:
human feces

# Data Description:
three age- and sex-matched groups from the Old Order Amish.

(1)	50 obese subjects (BMI >30 kg/m2) with one or more dysmetabolic manifestations

(2)	50 obese subjects (BMI > 30kg/m2) without any dysmetabolism manifestation

(3)	50 nonobese subjects (BMI < 25kg/m2) without any features of metabolic syndrome 

# reads processing
Sequences were binned and trimmed, using the sample-specific barcode sequences, using mothur and the following criteria:

(i) sequence length > 199 base; < 501 base

Taxonomy assignments were done by kmer-based naive-Bayes classification via mothur classify.seqs applied to the GreenGenes reference sequences and taxonomy, with a confidence cutoff of 0.5. 

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined using mothur by 

(i) alignment to the SILVA 16S rRNA database

(ii) clustering by bacterial family, and a distance cutoff of 0.03
