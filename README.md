# MDS-16S rRNA

## Biological background
>The etiology of obesity and its metabolic complications, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance and diabetes reflect the complex interactions of multiple genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. Great inter-individual variation is apparent in the propensity toward obesity, the location where excess fat is deposited, and the extent to which this results in metabolic derangements and adverse health outcomes.

>To explore the possible dysbiosis of gut microbiota in obesity and its metabolic complications in humans, we studied Old Order Amish subjects from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

>There is great uniformity of socioeconomic status and lifestyle among the Amish, and prescription medication usage is minimal, reducing the potentially confounding influences of variation in environmental exposures on complex traits. Extensive genealogies document a small number of founders and genetic analyses confirm less genetic heterogeneity relative to the general population. These attributes make the Amish a highly desirable population in which to study the composition of the gut microbiota, its heritability, and its relationship to obesity and metabolic complications.
